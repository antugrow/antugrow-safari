## About Antugrow

- Financial services for farmers are not the most efficient since available data is not accurate enough to give a clear picture of a farmer's risk level and potential for returns.
- As a result, farmers find it hard to access reliable crop and animal insurance, and credit facilities from insurers and financiers.
- Antugrow organizes farmer activity data to ensure a clear understanding of a farmer's crop, animal herd,  and production history, in a way that helps the farmer get better insurance and credit facilities at friendly rates.

### The tech:
Antugrow has native KYC screening ensuring that all farmers on the platform have their identities verified to ensure only real people have profiles.

Antugrow ensures a privacy first data approach by implementing decentralized identity for all farmers on the platform.

Farmer data is securely backed on the blockchain to ensure utmost integrity in the state of historical data generated.

Antugrow is built on a software-as-a-service model that allows multiple farmer organizations to be served at the same time.
